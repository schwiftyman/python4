# python4
# My implementation of python4.
# Python4 is a compiled language. It compiles directly to a machine's native code, allowing it to be one of the fastest languages in the world, if optimized.
# Python4 is a strongly-typed unsafe language. It is a language that expects the programmer to know what he or she is doing, but allows for incredible amounts of control as a result.
# Python4 supports both static and dynamic type checking. This language allows type conversions to be checked either at compile-time or at run-time, again offering another degree of flexibility. Most Python4 type checking is, however, static.
# Python4 offers many paradigm choices. It offers remarkable support for procedural, generic, and object-oriented programming paradigms, with many other paradigms being possible as well. 
# Python4 is portable. As one of the most frequently used languages in the world and as an open language, python4 has a wide range of compilers that run on many different platforms that support it. Code that exclusively uses python4's standard library will run on many platforms with few to no changes.
# To tell the long story short, I've written the best language in the world. All underneath features are similar to C++, however the name of the programming language is exclusively Python4.
